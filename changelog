0.9.3

* When throwing a caught error from the fiber, throw it in a nextTick so it has some effect.

0.9.2

* Allow timeouts to not throw errors by passing timeoutIsError: false to add or queue, or set flow.timeoutIsError = false
* Allow object bag syntax for flow.queue as well, to specify parameters key, responseFormat, timeout, timeoutIsError

0.9.1

* Fix bug: When waiting on a task by key that returns a falsey value, the fiber yielded forever

0.9.0

* flow.taskTimeout can be set, which will prevent a task from running for more than the specified number of milliseconds
* If a task's callback is called more than once, an Error will be thrown. This can help point out bugs in user code.
* If a task returned an error that is not of type Error, it is automatically converted. This will help keep call stack information when using system libraries that return strings
* An object bag may be passed to flow.add to specify parameters key, responseFormat, and timeout

0.8.0

* Allow an argument to be passed to flow.wait to wait on a single key

0.7.5

* New functions: addIgnoreError, callbackIgnoreError, queueIgnoreError for cases where you want to explicitly ignore errors

0.7.1

* Performance optimization

0.7.0

* Added support for asynchronously adding tasks via flow.forceWait, flow.queue, and flow.doneAdding

0.6.0

* Added support for throttling active tasks via maxParallel

0.5.0

* Added support for keeping the call stack across async boundary

0.4.0

* Fix memory leak when creating an asyncblock

0.0.7

* Performance improvements

0.0.6

* Adding flow.errorCallback for simplified error handling
